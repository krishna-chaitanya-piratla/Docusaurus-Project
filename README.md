# Docusaurus-Project
This is a sample documentation website built using Docusaurus.

This project can be run locally on port 3000 to view the site. 

The tutorial-extras folder contains the page that illustrates content pulled from other markdown files. (This avoids duplication of content while building documentation websites)
