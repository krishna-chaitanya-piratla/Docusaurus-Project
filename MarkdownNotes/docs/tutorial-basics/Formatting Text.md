# Formatting Text

## Bold and Italic

To make text **bold**, wrap the words with double asterisks (`**`) or double underscores (`__`).

To make text *italic*, wrap the words with single asterisks (`*`) or single underscores (`_`).

```
**Bold Text**
__Bold Text__

*Italic Text*
_Italic Text_
```

## Strikethrough

You can add strikethrough to text using double tildes (`~~`).

```
~~Strikethrough Text~~
```

## Combined Formatting

You can combine formatting styles as well.

```
**_Bold and Italic Text_**
```
